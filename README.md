# bicep-demo

## Setup

The samples in this repo assume you are working within a Windows environment and have PowerShell available on your machine (ideally PowerShell 7), although getting them to run on Linux should be fairly trivial.

If you don't have Az CLI available on your machine please run the `setup.ps1` file found in the root of the repo.

Once you have all the required tooling installed, ensure that you are logged into the Azure context you want to run the demo scripts in! You can do this interactively from your PowerShell terminal by running `az login`.
